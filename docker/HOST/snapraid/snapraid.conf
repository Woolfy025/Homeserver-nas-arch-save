# Example configuration for snapraid - MODIFIED ONLY THE RELEVANT PARTS - ADJUST TO YOUR DISK MOUNT POINTS!

# ADJUST THIS LINE - TO THE PARITY DISK
# Defines the file to use as parity storage
# It must NOT be in a data disk
# Format: "parity FILE [,FILE] ..."
parity /mnt/disks/parity1/snapraid.parity

# Defines the files to use as additional parity storage.
# If specified, they enable the multiple failures protection
# from two to six level of parity.
# To enable, uncomment one parity file for each level of extra
# protection required. Start from 2-parity, and follow in order.
# It must NOT be in a data disk
# Format: "X-parity FILE [,FILE] ..."

# ADJUST THESE LINES - TO THE DISKS YOU WILL PROTECT + SYSTEM DISK TO STORE CONTENT FILE
# Defines the files to use as content list
# You can use multiple specification to store more copies
# You must have least one copy for each parity file plus one. Some more don't hurt
# They can be in the disks used for data, parity or boot,
# but each file must be in a different disk

# ADJUST THESE LINES - TO THE SUBVOLS YOU WOULD LIKE TO PROTECT (1 PER DISK)
# Defines the data disks to use
# The name and mount point association is relevant for parity, do not change it
# WARNING: Adding here your /home, /var or /tmp disks is NOT a good idea!
