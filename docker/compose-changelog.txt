# CHANGELOG 2023-01-07
# CHANGED: docker-compose.yml now uses a named volume (see the end of the file) for Filerun. Make sure you also update the volume for user-files within the filerun service.
# FIXED: This change for Filerun is required, to prevent a new device ID being generated after rebooting your server. This caused NextCloud/Owncloud clients to believe the synced folder was completely deleted, causing the client to re-download all data from the server. More information here: https://feedback.filerun.com/communities/1/topics/1649-after-server-reboot-owncloud-always-re-downloads-everything

# CHANGELOG 2022-08-29
# FIXED: In the Vaultwarden environment variables section, added the protocol (https) as this is a requirement. It doesn't seem to affect existing users but new users without existing Vaultwarden persistent volumes were affected. Thanks to P3nkiln in https://github.com/zilexa/Homeserver/pull/13. 

# CHANGELOG 2022-08-22
# FIXED: Removed typo in Adguard Home volume mapping (accidental double slash instead of single in the path).
# FIXED: Removed unnecessary Adguard Home volume mapping for "work" config. 
# CHANGED: Removed healthcheck in Unbound, it doesn't work because the Unbound image is distroless. No interest in figuring this out anyway. Unbound is a pretty static system that just works as is. 

# CHANGELOG 2022-07-29
# CHANGED: VPN-proxy (docker-wireguard-pia); uncommented VPNDNS variable, VPNDNS: $VPNDNS and added $VPNDNS to .env file. Reason: since we are running our own DNS server, no need to use public or PIA dns servers. Also, the image seems to have an issue with PIA own DNS resolver: https://github.com/thrnz/docker-wireguard-pia/issues/55

# CHANGELOG 2022-07-27
# CHANGED: Guacamole subdomain from "desktop." to "remote." as it makes more sense, you can use it for SSH and other protocols, besides desktop sharing.

# CHANGELOG 2022-07-18
# ADDED: Guacamole is added again, by request of many.
# ADDED: Instructions for Guacamole https://github.com/zilexa/Homeserver/blob/master/Applications-Overview.md#remote-desktop-web-client-guacamole
# REMOVED: unused networks
# FIXED: Plugsy is now finally reachable through a domain, without port: http://g.o solved by adding `extra_hosts` thanks to @airtonix see https://github.com/plugsy/core/issues/31#issuecomment-1186396720
# CHANGED: replaced Unbound image of Matthew Vance for the image of Klutchell. Used to have Klutchell, was misinformed about it and switched to Matthew Vance. I will do more research as one seems to be optimised for security, the other for privacy. Not entirely clear. For now Klutchell seems the best choice. 

# CHANGELOG 2022-07-02
# REMOVED: Guacamole, as it isn't a much used tool in a homeserver situation and native clients such as Remmina (Mac, Linux, Android) or Windows RDP client work better.
# REMOVED: The whole Grafana/Prometheus stack as it didn't work. 
# CHANGED: renamed Media to media and Users to users to follow the filesystem guide; non-user folders should not have caps. 

# CHANGELOG 2022-06-03
# ADDED: VPN-Portal now supports lots of env variables to properly configure a mesh network via your Wireguard server config file! 
# ADDED: The .env file now includes variables for VPN-portal and is restructured. 
# REMOVED: OnlyOffice Documentserver, cannot get it working. 
# ADDED: Prometheus, Grafana, Alerts etc from dockprom (see his github). Not working yet. 

# CHANGELOG 2022-05-16
# ADDED: all services with a webUI are now proxied through a local domain, including the ones that use network_mode: host (AdGuard Home and VPN-portal (=wireguard-ui)). 
# REMOVED: obsolete ports sections for VPN portal, since it runs on host network, the port is exposed anyway. 
# ISSUE: Plugsy cannot be proxied: https://github.com/plugsy/core/issues/31 very annoying.
# ISSUE: OnlyOffice Documentserver has issues on a Manjaro host. Very strange issue, NOT fixed: https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/Docker-DocumentServer/issues/426

# CHANGELOG 2022-04-22
# ADDED: labels to every non-exposed container to allow access each service via its own local subdomain. Please add these domains to your AdGuard Home>Settings>DNS Rewrites
# ADDED: labels added to every container with a UI to populate a simple startpage (by flame container)
# ADDED: Added Flame, a nice startpage. access via IP:5005 or http://start.o, go to settings, enable docker to show all services with the flame labels. 
# REMOVED: Per-category docker bridge networks, since all containers with a UI require to be in the web-proxy network for subdomain access.

# CHANGELOG 2022-04-11
# UPDATED: Hotio images have a new source. 
# CHANGED: For all services, first item is container_name, second is image source.  

# CHANGELOG 2022-04-08
# UPDATED: Now works with all latest containers. 
# CHANGED: 'true' to true everywhere.
# CHANGED: CADDY-DOCKER-PROXY: renamed contaimer name:'caddy-proxy to 'web-proxy', its network (unchanged) has the same name. 
# CHANGED: CADDY-DOCKER-PROXY: latest version requires an env variable, this has been added.
# CHANGED: CADDY-DOCKER-PROXY: requires you to run "docker network create web-proxy" BEFORE running compose!
  
# CHANGELOG 2021-05-15
# CHANGED: Bitwarden_rs has been renamed by the developer to Vaultwarden, renamed the image, volume path, env variable

# CHANGELOG 2021-05-01
# REMOVED: PULLIO notify labels. It cannot send email notifications, only Discord which I and most people I believe don't use. 
## KEPT: PULLIO update labels, for media/download related containers, to update all of them with 1 command (manually or scheduled). 
# CHANGED: Scrutiny, an attempt to disable its interval based SMART scan, so that this can be done via the NIGHTLY, script.
## REASON: It will spin up all drives just for the SMART scan. Better to do this when they are already spinning. 
# CLEANUP: Changed order of values, to have consistency for each and every container.

# CHANGELOG 2021-04-28
## REMOVED: Watchtower. Replaced with Pullio bash script. For a weekly update check, running a daemon like Watchtower makes no sense. 
## CHANGED: VPN-proxy back to Frankfurt, for some reason Swiss doesn't work, the server TLS certificate is outdated. 
## REPLACED IMAGE: QBittorrent image with the one from Hotio because it has unrar and doesn't create files with root-only access.
## REPLACED ALL MEDIA RELATED IMAGES: all images are now from Hotio.
## CHANGED: Scrutiny requires a yaml config file to recognise NVME drives. see my github for an example. 
## CHANGED: Ports of VPN-proxy to allow access to QBittorrent as it listens on a different port for the webUI.  

# CHANGELOG 2021-04-13
## ADDED Guacamole! Now you can open your browser and access the desktop of your server. The image works, still have to test Guacamole. 
## Removed Transmission as nobody seems to use it anymore, even though it had full Sonarr compatibility, it is riddled with config issues:
## temp folder will never be used with Sonarr/Radarr, making the filesystem optimisations (disabling CoW & seperate subvolume for incomplete dir)
## Completely useless, allowing fragmentation. Also, the complete dir is changed during downloading via Sonarr. Devs believe this is all normal behaviour.
## ADDED QBittorrent, not from Linuxserver as it is 360MB versus this 150MB image. 
## ToDO: Will look into using Hotio QFlood image instead, the UI is much nicer but seems to lack important settings to increase disk cache etc.
## REMOVED unneccessary port binds: 80 for Caddy is not used. Now used for Organizr to access server homepage via url (use your servers /etc/hosts file to set an url). 
## ToDO: Will look into registering https for LAN only, to access all services via https organizr url (not sure if it makes sense to go this far). 
## CHANGED: pia wireguard vpn to swiss instead of nine eyes Germany.
## NOTE: I stopped using Syncthing due to this issue (my laptop SSD filled up within 30min): https://forum.syncthing.net/t/problems-with-renamed-directory/16611
## I might try Resilio instead or see if the dev is helpful to figure out the issue, if it isn't "by design".
